The goal of this project was to combine individual player weapon stats across multiple Apex Legends tournaments with team and player stats.
The end goal is being able to cross filter between any individual player, team or weapon and get corresponding stats seamlessly.
A summary of the overall process can be viewed in the pdf file named "Apex_Dashboard_Project".

Next steps are to keep adding data to the model, for example, individual day data and placement data. With placement data, the goal is to
understand how likely teams are to win based on team and player variables. I would also like to answer some interesting questions with hypothesis 
testing.
